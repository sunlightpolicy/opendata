* a. **Purpose**. In order to increase transparency, accountability, and informed public participation, and to create economic development opportunities, Cook County (“County”) departments and agencies, including the offices of the separately elected County officials (“County Officials” or “County Agency”) shall expand access to information, by making certain information available online in a machine-readable, open format, that can be retrieved, downloaded, indexed, sorted, searched, and reused by commonly used Web search applications and commonly used open format software that facilitate access to, and the reuse of, such information.  

* b. **Website**. In not less than 90 days, the Cook County shall establish www.OpenCC.info, a common website that shall serve as the source for countywide and departmental activities related to this Open Cook County Initiative (the Website). County Officials shall use their best efforts to publish information to the Website, including, but not limited to: revenue, spending and procurement information; crime and health statistics; contracts with private firms; policies or procedures; and other data or information commonly requested pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in a format consistent with the standards set forth herein.  

* c. **Schedule**. Inasmuch as timely and consistent publication of information is an essential component of open government, the County shall develop schedules for making information available to the public and indicating when such information is updated.  

* d. With respect to County information and data, the presumption shall be in favor of openness, to the extent permitted by law and subject to valid privacy, confidentiality, security, or other restrictions and exemptions afforded under FOIA or other applicable federal, state of local laws. Where practicable, County Officials shall publish all data that is not subject to valid exemptions provided under FOIA as well as privacy, security, or privilege limitations or that is not otherwise made available by the County pursuant to other initiatives.  

* e. Within 120 days, each County Agency shall create a catalog of its public information. The catalog shall be accessible through this Open Cook County Initiative Website.

previously non-publicly accessible information.  

* h. The Website shall additionally include a mechanism that shall allow for the public to provide feedback to the County on, and assess the quality of, published information. This mechanism shall additionally allow for recommendations from the public to the County of other information to consider prioritizing for publication.  

* i. Each County Agency shall engage in its best efforts to respond to public feedback received via the Website on a regular, timely basis. Responses to such public feedback may include descriptions of actions taken, or reasons for not taking action, based on such public feedback received.  

* j. Each County Agency shall publish every FOIA request in an open format on the Website, unless a request is subject to valid privacy, security, or privilege limitations. If a request is subject to limitation, there shall be a redacted version of the request released that discloses the nature of the request, but not the specifics of the request. Each FOIA request shall be listed in conjunction with the status of the request and whether such request has been fulfilled.  

* k. Where deemed appropriate, the County may assert or establish any licensure or use restrictions for information provided on the Website.  

* l. Within 120 days, each County Agency shall develop and publish an Open Government Plan (“Plan”) that shall describe how each department will enhance and develop transparency, public participation, and collaboration. The Open Government Plan shall describe steps the County Agency will take to conduct its work more openly and to publish its information online. The Plan shall describe how the County Agency is currently meeting its legal information dissemination obligations under FOIA and how the County Agency plans to create more access to information and opportunities for public participation.

* n. Within 45 days, the President shall establish a working group that focuses on transparency, accountability, public participation, and collaboration within County government. This group, with senior level representation from other County Agencies, shall serve several critical functions, including:
  * (1) Transparency Forum. The working group shall provide a forum to share best practices on innovative ideas to promote transparency. This shall include system and process solutions for information collection, aggregation, validation, and dissemination; and
  * (2) Participation and Collaboration Forum. The working group shall provide a forum to share best practices on innovative ideas to promote participation and collaboration, including how to experiment with new technologies, take advantage of the expertise and insight of people both inside and outside of County government, and form high-impact collaborations with researchers, the private sector, and the public; and
 * (3) Public Input Forum. The working group shall provide a forum for developing resolutions to issues in accordance with Sec. 2-5(h) herein.
