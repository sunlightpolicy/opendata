### GOVERNMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
### EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE MAYOR 
Office of the City Administrator
#### MEMORANDUM
 
FROM: Robert Bobb, City Administrator  
TO: All Agency Heads and Directors  
RE: Streaming of DCStat Data to www.dc.gov  
 
This memorandum informs that DCStat is going to make available on the internet the data that the District staff can access on the intranet.
 
The District of Columbia is joining the national trend of local governments in providing public access to information directly through the Internet. **Starting June 12**, the District will begin streaming data that the agencies gather through
normal operations to the www.dc.gov web site in Really Simple Syndication (RSS) format. Currently this information is managed by DCStat and shared with the staff only through the District's intranet.

DCStat is the program which was instituted in 2004 by the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) pursuant to my direction that the District of Columbia provide key information about city conditions from multiple agencies/sources in a
real time basis to facilitate accountable, cost-effective, data-driven, customer focused management.
 
Attached is a chart showing the data bases and the corresponding target publication date. The first content to be published will be **resident requests for service** called into the Mayor's Citywide Call Center, including the associated Hansen status reports.
 
**It is important that agencies and directors take all necessary steps to closeout or update any cases that may still be open for your agency in preparation for this release.**
 
I have directed the Center for Innovation and Reform to establish and lead a steering committee to help guide the implementation of this initiative and to ensure close coordination with the affected agencies.
 
Also attached are the general guidelines DCStat will follow when posting information on the District's web site. The first meeting of the ad hoc committee will be held the week of May 15th. A meeting invitation will follow. Direct any questions in the meantime to Oscar Rodriguez, Director of the Center for Innovation and Reform at 727-9071.
