# City of San Diego Open Data Policy

**EFFECTIVE DATE: January 1, 2015**

## BACKGROUND:

The City of San Diego is committed to the principles of open, accessible, efficient, and transparent government, and the use of technology to help put those principles into practice. On December 17, 2013, the San Diego City Council approved San Diego Resolution R-308684 (Jan. 2, 2014) in support of creating an open data policy.

## PURPOSE:

This policy creates a process for making City data available online using open standards. The City will devote its best efforts to making its data publicly available online, while recognizing that it has numerous data sets and limited resources to dedicate to a new open data program. The City recognizes that making data available online in this manner will promote civic engagement, improve service delivery, allow for more effective communication with the public, and increase opportunities for economic development. This Policy is also intended to make the operation of City government more transparent, effective, and accountable to the public, and to allow the public to assist in identifying efficient solutions for government.

If the Chief Data Officer determines that Voluntary Compliance Standards are not suitable, then the Chief Data Officer shall identify the reasons why they are not suitable. The technical guidelines shall require a web application programming interface that permits application programs to request and receive Public Data Sets directly from the Web Portal. The technical guidelines shall be reviewed annually and updated as necessary by the Chief Data Officer.

  **2.4** -- No later than 180 days from the Effective Date of this Policy, the Chief Data Officer shall submit a written report to the Mayor and the Council on the status of implementation of this Policy and publish the report on the City web site.

  b. a timeline for publication to the Web Portal of high value existing Public Data Sets, as determined by the Chief Data Officer after soliciting public input, with all high value Public Data Sets being published within five years of the Effective Date of this Policy; and

  c. for any high value Public Data Set that cannot be made available on the Web Portal within the specified time, a statement of the reasons why the high value Public Data Set cannot be made available and, to the extent practicable, the date by which the City Department believes that it will be available on the Web Portal.

  **2.6** -- The annual updates to the Compliance Plan shall include the specific measures undertaken to make additional Public Data Sets available on the Web Portal since the immediately preceding update, specific measures that will be undertaken prior to the next update, an update to the inventory of Public Data Sets, and, if necessary, any changes to the prioritization of Public Data Sets and an update to the timeline for the inclusion of Public Data Sets on the Web Portal. If a Public Data Set cannot be made available on the Web Portal on or before the Compliance Plan update, the update shall state the reasons it cannot and, to the extent practicable, the date by which the City believes the Public Data Set will be available on the Web Portal.

  **2.7** -- The Chief Data Officer shall ensure that an appropriate disclaimer and terms of use are placed on the City web site which shall include, but not be limited to, the following: (a) Public Data Sets are provided for informational purposes only; (b) the City does not warranty the completeness, accuracy, content, or fitness for any particular purpose or use of any Public Data Set made available on the Web Portal, nor are any such warranties to be implied or inferred with respect to the Public Data Sets furnished therein; and (c) the City is not liable for any deficiencies in the completeness, accuracy, content, or fitness for any particular purpose or use of any Public Data Set, or application utilizing such data set. This open data policy shall not be construed to create a private right of action to enforce its provisions, and failure to comply with this policy shall not result in liability to the City. For purposes of clarity, nothing in Section 2.7 prevents Public Data Sets from being used for any lawful purpose, including use of the Public Data Sets to develop commercial applications.

  **3.5** -- Public Data Sets shall be made available without any registration requirement, license requirement, or restrictions on their lawful use.
