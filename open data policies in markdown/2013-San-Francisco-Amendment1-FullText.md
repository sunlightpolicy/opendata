####San Francisco Administrative Code  

####CHAPTER 22D:  
####OPEN DATA POLICY  

####SEC. 22D.1.  FINDINGS.  

(a) An open data policy will provide benefits to the City, which include:  

* (1) enhanced government transparency and accountability;  
* (2) development of new analyses or applications based on the unique data the City provides;  
* (3) mobilization of San Francisco's high-tech workforce to use City data to create useful civic tools at no cost to the City; and  
* (4) creation of social and economic benefits based on innovation in how residents interact with government stemming from increased accessibility to City data sets.  

(b) On October 21, 2009, Mayor Newsom issued Executive Directive 09-06, entitled Open Data ("the Directive"). The Directive stated the City's commitment to transparency in government by declaring that all appropriate data sets would be published through a designated website.  

(c) City departments should take further steps to make their data sets available to the public in a more timely and efficient manner.

* (5) Present an annual updated citywide implementation plan to COIT, the Mayor, and Board of Supervisors and respond, as necessary, regarding the status of DataSF in the City;  
* (6) Actively work to further the goals of open data in the City;

* (2) Conduct quarterly reviews of their progress on providing access to data sets requested by the public through the designated web portal beginning six months after the appointment of the CDO; and

Each DC shall work with the CDO to implement the City's open data policies and standards. The DC shall prepare an Open Data plan for the Department which shall:  
  * (A) Include a timeline for the publication of the Department's open data and a summary of open data efforts planned and/or underway in the Department;

  * (C) Prioritize all public data sets for inclusion on DataSF;

    * (ii) Data sets that contain personally identifiable information or represent potential breaches to security or privacy should be flagged for potential exclusion from DataSF; and,  
    * (iii) Data sets should be free of charge to the public through the web portal.

###SEC. 22D.3.  STANDARDS AND COMPLIANCE.

(a) The CDO shall establish for adoption by COIT rules and standards to implement the open data policy, including developing standards to determine which data sets are appropriate for public disclosure.

(b) The CDO shall promulgate and COIT shall adopt rules and standards to implement the open data policy which shall apply to all Departments, consistent with COIT's role and responsibilities in San Francisco Administrative Code Section 22A.3. The CDO and COIT intend to work with the City Attorney's Office and purchaser to develop contract provisions to promote open data policies. The rules and standards shall include the following:  

* (1) Technical requirements for the publishing of public data sets by Departments for the purpose of making public data available to the greatest number of users and for the greatest number of applications. These rules shall, whenever practicable, use non-proprietary technical standards for web publishing and e-government;  
* (2) Guidelines for Departments to follow in developing their plans for implementing the open data policy consistent with the standards established by COIT. Each plan shall include an accounting of public data sets under the control of the Department;  
* (3) Rules for including open data requirements in applicable City contracts and standard contract provisions that promote the City's open data policies, including, where appropriate, provisions to ensure that the City retains ownership of City data and the ability to post the data on data.sfgov.org or make it available through other means; and,  
* (4) Requirements that a third party providing City data (or applications based on City data) to the public explicitly identify the source and version of the public data set, and include a description of any modifications made to the public data set.
