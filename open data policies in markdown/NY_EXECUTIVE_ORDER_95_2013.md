Printer-friendly version

**WHEREAS**, the State possesses vast amounts of valuable information and reports on all aspects of life in New York State, including health, business, public safety, and labor data as well as information on transportation, parks, and recreation; and
 
**WHEREAS**, new information technology has dramatically changed the way people search for and expect to find information, and such technology can aggregate ever larger quantities of data and allow government to provide information to the public with increasing efficiency; and   
 
**WHEREAS**, the State can use these powerful tools to enhance public access to government data and make government in New York State more transparent in order to promote public trust; and
 
**WHEREAS**, ensuring the quality and consistency of such data is essential to maintaining its value and utility;
 
**NOW, THEREFORE**, I, Andrew M. Cuomo, Governor of the State of New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the State of New York, do hereby order as follows:  
 
A.  Online Website.  An online Open Data Website for the collection and public dissemination of Publishable State data, and, to the extent feasible, reports is hereby established. The Open Data Website shall be maintained at data.ny.gov or such other successor website maintained by, or on behalf of, the State, as deemed appropriate by the New York State Office of Information Technology Services in consultation with the Governor’s Office and Data Working Group established below.  The Open Data Website will provide “single-stop” access to Publishable State data that is owned, controlled, collected or otherwise maintained by covered State entities as defined herein and, to the extent feasible, reports of such covered State entities.

1.  “Covered State entity” means (i) any State agency or department, or any office, division, bureau, or board of such State agency or department, except where the head of such agency or department is not appointed by the Governor, (ii) any State board, committee, or commission, at least one of whose members is appointed by the Governor, and (iii) all public-benefit corporations, public authorities and commissions, for which the Governor appoints the Chair, the Chief Executive, or the majority of Board Members, except for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.  

2.  “Chief Data Officer” shall mean the New York State Chief Data Officer in the Office of Information Technology Services or a designee thereof;
