(a) Compliance Date and Annual Reports. By no later than September 30, 2013 and thereafter, the public data sets that agencies make available on the Internet shall be accessible through a single web portal that is linked to the city’s website. Each agency shall be responsible for identifying and publishing data sets. The Department shall be available to agencies for consultation and technical support only. The Department shall not be responsible for identifying or publishing data sets. By December 31, 2013 and annually thereafter, if an agency cannot or will not make all of its publicly available data sets available through the City’s website, the agency shall file a written report with the Department and with the Common Council setting forth which public data set or sets that it is not making available, the reasons why it cannot or will not do so and the date by which the agency expects that any such public data set or sets will be available on the city’s website.
(b) Metadata. Such public data sets shall have metadata (information about the data set) made available to the public through the single web portal. Agencies will be responsible for providing the metadata as defined by the Department. The Department shall provide all agencies with a template for metadata.

Such public data sets shall be made available in accordance with technical standards published by the Department and shall be in a format that permits automated processing using open standards where practical and shall make use of appropriate technology to notify the public of all updates.

Stats. §§ 19.31-19.47) and the Madison Public Records ordinance (Sec. 3.70, MGO).
