<p>City of San José City Policy Manual</p> <p>Open Data Policy (DRAFT) Section X.X.X</p> <p>The City of San Jose is committed to freely sharing as much information as possible. We</p> <p>recognize that information is a valuable resource and a strategic asset to the public. Making</p> <p>information accessible, discoverable, and usable by the public can help fuel entrepreneurship,</p> <p>innovation, scientific discovery, and a more efficient government.</p> <p>In 2016 the City will launch an open data portal and adopt an open data policy. Over the next</p> <p>few months, the City will gather community input through a digital survey and a series of public</p> <p>events.</p> <p>We appreciate your interest in the City of San Jose’s Draft Open Data Policy. This is a draft</p> <p>and is subject to further revision. As part of our commitment to transparency and community</p> <p>engagement, we welcome your interest and feedback on how we can make this policy more</p> <p>effective. Please send comments or a draft of this document with your suggested revisions to</p> <p>opendata@sanjoseca.gov.</p> <p>If you have questions, please contact Kevin Miller at kevin.miller@sanjoseca.gov.</p> <p>City of San José City Policy Manual</p> <p>Open Data Policy (DRAFT) Section X.X.X</p> <p>PURPOSE</p> <p>The purpose of this policy is to affirm the City of San José’s commitment to open, honest, and</p> <p>effective government. The City strives to consistently meet the community’s expectations for</p> <p>excellent services in a positive and timely manner, and in full view of the public. Open Data is</p> <p>an important component of this commitment; through making its data publicly available and</p> <p>easily accessible, the City of San José will empower the community to engage with government</p> <p>on a new level and stimulate new ideas, new services, and new economic opportunities. In</p> <p>addition, Open Data will provide a new platform to increase the sharing of information among</p> <p>City Departments, improving the City’s ability to deliver services to the community efficiently and</p> <p>effectively.</p> <p>DEFINITIONS</p> <p>Common Data Standards: Any set of data collection standards agreed upon by multiple</p> <p>stakeholders designed to promote interoperability and facilitate the efficient exchange and use</p> <p>of information collected in different systems.</p> <p>Data: Structured information.</p> <p>Dataset: A collection of data presented in tabular or non-tabular form.</p> <p>Data Source: A system, database, or other information source that contains and reports raw</p> <p>data.</p> <p>Information Lifecycle: The stages through which information passes, typically characterized as</p> <p>creation or collection, processing, dissemination, use, storage, and disposition.</p> <p>Interoperability: The ability of different information technology systems, software and data</p> <p>applications to communicate and exchange data, and use the information that has been</p> <p>exchanged.</p> <p>Metadata: Data that describes a dataset. Metadata summarizes basic information about a</p> <p>dataset, such as the date range covered by a dataset, a description of the dataset, the manager</p> <p>or steward of the dataset, etc.</p> <p>Open Data: The method by which data is made open and freely available to the public to be</p> <p>republished, manipulated, or used in any other way without restriction.</p> <p>Open Data Portal: The internet site established and maintained on behalf of the City, located</p> <p>at http://data.sanjoseca.gov</p> <p>POLICY</p> <p>It is the policy of the City of San José that the data it collects and generates will, to the extent</p> <p>practicable, be open by default. City Departments, with support from the Information</p> <p>Technology Department, will publish all appropriate datasets and associated metadata</p> <p>controlled by that department on the City’s Open Data Portal, except where the posting of such</p> <p>data would violate privacy or security concerns. Every reasonable effort shall be made to</p> <p>City of San José City Policy Manual</p> <p>Open Data Policy (DRAFT) Section X.X.X</p> <p>frequently update datasets on the Open Data Portal to the extent that the Department regularly</p> <p>maintains or updates such data.</p> <p>New information systems shall, to the extent practicable, have the ability to report data in a</p> <p>manner consistent with the open data standards outlined in the Open Data Standards section</p> <p>below. When updating existing legacy systems, departments shall make a reasonable effort to</p> <p>ensure that such systems have the ability to report data in a way that meets the open data</p> <p>standards as outlined in the Open Data Standards section below.</p> <p>On a case by case basis, to facilitate the acquisition of systems that meet open data standards,</p> <p>additional consideration for meeting the Open Data Standards section below will be</p> <p>incorporated into an RFP’s evaluation criteria for scoring RFP responses.

City information shall be managed</p> <p>as an asset throughout its lifecycle to promote interoperability and openness, and, wherever</p> <p>possible and legally permissible, to ensure that data is released to the public in ways that make</p> <p>the data easy to find, accessible, and usable by the public. The City remains committed to</p> <p>safeguarding individual privacy, confidentiality, and security and will not post information that is</p> <p>legally protected or poses a threat to security, safety or the general well-being of the community.</p> <p>When designing new information collection and creation efforts, City of San José Departments</p> <p>should support downstream interoperability between information systems and dissemination of</p> <p>information to the public, as appropriate, without the need for retrofitting. This includes</p> <p>consideration and consultation of key target audiences for the information when determining</p> <p>format, frequency of update, and other information management decisions. Specifically,</p> <p>Departments must incorporate the following requirements into future information collection and</p> <p>creation efforts:</p> <p>Use machine-readable and open formats: To the extent practicable, Departments must use</p> <p>machine-readable and open formats for information as it is collected or created. While</p> <p>information should be collected electronically by default, machine-readable and open formats</p> <p>must also be used in conjunction with electronic and telephone or paper-based information</p> <p>collection efforts. Departments should prioritize the use of open formats that are nonproprietary,</p> <p>publicly available, and that place no restrictions upon their use.</p> <p>Use data standards: To the extent practicable, and where common data standards are</p> <p>defined, Departments shall use such common data standards in the collection and creation of</p> <p>information to promote data interoperability and openness. </p> <p>City of San José City Policy Manual</p> <p>Open Data Policy (DRAFT) Section X.X.X</p> <p>Ensure information stewardship through the use of open licenses: To the extent</p> <p>practicable, Departments shall apply open licenses to information as it is collected or created to</p> <p>ensure that as data is made public, there are no restrictions on copying, publishing, distributing,</p> <p>transmitting, adapting, or otherwise using the information for non-commercial or commercial</p> <p>purposes. When information is acquired or accessed by a Department through performance of</p> <p>a contract, appropriate existing clauses shall be used to meet these objectives while recognizing</p> <p>that contractors may have proprietary interests in such information, and that protection of such</p> <p>information may be necessary to encourage qualified contractors to participate in and apply</p> <p>innovative concepts to government programs.</p> <p>Ensure frequent updates: To the extent practicable, Departments shall work with the</p> <p>Information Technology Department to provide frequent updates to data hosted on the Open</p> <p>Data Portal to the extent the Department regularly maintains or updates such data.</p> <p>TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS</p> <p>New information systems shall, to the extent practicable, have the ability to report data in a</p> <p>manner consistent with the open data standards outlined in the Open Data Standards section</p> <p>above.
